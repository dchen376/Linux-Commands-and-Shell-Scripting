# Linux-Commands-and-Shell-Scripting
This is a personal project with shell scripts to back up files that have been updated in the past 24 hours.


Scenario:
You are a lead Linux developer at the top-tech company ABC International Inc. As one of ABC Inc.'s most trusted Linux developers, you have been tasked with creating a script called backup.sh which runs every day and automatically backs up any encrypted password files that have been updated in the past 24 hours.


notes: Shell scripting refers to writing scripts or programs using shell commands, primarily for automating tasks within a Unix or Unix-like operating system.
